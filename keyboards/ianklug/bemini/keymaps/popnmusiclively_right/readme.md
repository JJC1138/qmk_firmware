# A bemini keymap for pop'n music Lively

This keymap aims to let you do everything in pop'n music Lively on the bemini including using the game menus.

The main nine buttons control gameplay, of course, and the other three extra buttons are mapped to (from top to bottom) Escape, F1, and a 'function' modifier that changes what all the other keys do when it is held down.

When the function modifier key is held, the gameplay buttons become the keypad numbers that are used in the menus of the game. 0-4 are on the bottom row of the bemini, and 5-8 on the top row. The top extra button becomes Backspace, and the middle extra button becomes 9 on the keypad.

This keymap is for the bemini configuration where the gameplay buttons are on the right and the extra buttons are on the left, so you'll need to swap your keyswitch positions to the 'P2' positions shown in the bemini documentation. The keymap was designed that way because it felt a little more natural to have the control buttons on the left.
