# PicoFX Default Keymap

The default keymap matches the 'Basic 2' preset in Pump It Up Rise. In the game's options menu, navigate to the keyboard settings and press '2' (on your normal computer keyboard) to apply the preset.

```
  Q           E         R           Y
        S                     G
  Z           C         V           N

 Test: Toggle to menu mode
```

Pressing the Test button toggles the controller into a menu mode that provides most of the keys you need to navigate the game's menus:
```
  Q           E        Tab          Up
       Esc                  Enter
 Left       Right     Space        Down

 Service: F1
 Test: Toggle back to game mode
```

It might take a little bit of practice to remember where everything is in menu mode. The rule of thumb is that the layout roughly corresponds to where those controls appear on the game's song selection screen. You can always just ignore the menu mode and use your normal computer keyboard for navigating the menus if you prefer.

In either mode, holding the Service button and pressing the Test button will put the controller into bootloader mode for installing new firmware versions.
